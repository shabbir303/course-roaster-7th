## How I managed State assignment this project
- First I set and empty arry in const variable in the left hand side and then equal and use state hook in the right hand side.
- secondly in the empty array, I set 2 thing, 1st thing is set a value and second thing is set a function
- if the value is an array or any other value instead of number of boolen we use ([]) in the useState hook
- if the value is number , we set the default number(0/or any number)
- if the value is boolean , we use true or false in the useState as default
- so we use state is global state management, local state management and session state mangment.
- Now we use it as local state management
